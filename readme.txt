Fathom is a simple, GDPR compliant Google Analytics alternative.

== Description ==

# The best Google Analytics alternative for WordPress
Fathom Analytics is a simple-to-use, privacy-focused (GDPR-compliant) website analytics tool for your WordPress site. You don‚Äôt have to edit the code in your WordPress template to start using our software.

üëâ **[Check out our live demo](https://app.usefathom.com/demo) or [sign up for a free 30-day trial](https://app.usefathom.com/register)**.

You‚Äôll need a [subscription](https://app.usefathom.com/register) to Fathom Analytics to start collecting stats with this plugin, and our pricing starts at just $14/month. Instead of generating revenue from your visitors' data, we charge a fair and sustainable price for all our plans. Our business model is privacy-first by design.

## Why use Fathom Analytics?
Google Analytics is time-consuming to use and difficult to understand. Google also kills off its popular software far too often (like Universal Analytics). That‚Äôs why Fathom Analytics exists: to make website analytics easy and quick to understand.

Thousands of customers, from governments and banks to small businesses and bloggers, trust their website analytics to Fathom.

### Import from Google Analytics
[We‚Äôve got an importer](https://usefathom.com/features/ga-importer) to save your UA (Universal Analytics) and GA4 data. Because we‚Äôve got unlimited data retention, you can keep and view your stats forever.

### Setup in minutes
Because Fathom Analytics is a [single line of code](https://usefathom.com/docs/script/embed), and our WordPress plugin doesn‚Äôt even require any coding, you can go from starting a trial to seeing real-time data within a few minutes. [Learn how to set up our plugin here](https://usefathom.com/docs/integrations/wordpress).

### Comply with privacy laws
The best lawyers and legal minds worldwide regarding digital privacy have ensured that Fathom Analytics is fully compliant with [GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy, PECR and more](https://usefathom.com/compliance).

### No cookie banners are required
We invented the now industry-standard method for anonymizing visitor data without using cookies. That means you don‚Äôt have to clutter your site or slow it down with cookie banner plugins or consent notices for your site‚Äôs analytics.

### Email reports
Get a snapshot of your website or websites delivered to your inbox so you can see your critical stats without even having to log into Fathom Analytics. These reports can be set up for any dashboard (or all of them) and sent to anyone (at your company, to your clients, whomever you want).

### Shared or private dashboards
Want to grant access to specific website dashboards for particular clients/employees? Or make your dashboard 100% public? Fathom Analytics lets you create private, public or passworded dashboards without needing an account.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

For more details about Fathom, [visit our website](https://usefathom.com) or check out [our documentation](https://usefathom.com/docs).

#### Why isn‚Äôt Fathom free like Google Analytics?

If you aren't paying for a product, you are the product. That's why Google Analytics is free, because they make enough money off the personal data their customers give them by using their analytics service. We charge a small and sustainable fee for Fathom because our business model is selling software, not data (these very different business models). Our customers gladly pay for our service because they know their data is safe with us and their visitors' privacy is protected. As a profitable business, we're in this for the long haul.

#### How long do you store my analytics data?

Forever. Meaning, as long as you are a customer, you can access your data all the way back to when you signed up for an account. 7 days, or even 30 days, doesn't give you a clear enough picture of if your website is trending up or down, which is why we give you data retention forever.

This update includes breaking changes, so please read this message.

#### 2.0.0 - November 15, 2019

Well first of all, we are sorry for the long delay in updating this plugin! We've been busy at work on Fathom V2 all year. In this major update of the wordpress plugin, we've ensured backward compatability but have modified the guidelines to include some of the new changes we have made. Firstly, the concept of a "Dashboard URL" doesn't exist within V2, and you simply use the CDN URL! Nice and easy. But we have left the Dashboard URL in place for our V1 users who self-host. We've also added the ability for V2 users to embed their dashboard & create a new tab in the admin menu.


#### 1.0.1 - October 10, 2018

Added support for tracking multiple sites in a single Fathom dashboard (requires Fathom v1.0.1).


#### 1.0.0 - September 10, 2018

Plugin release.
